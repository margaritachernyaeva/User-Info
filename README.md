# User-Info

  This is a "tableView" app that represents information about first github users. The structure of project is intended to be MVP, but it is not. (for a while)
  Changes and bugs that I would like to solve some day:
- Data should be not loading all the time, it has to be saved somewhere;
- MVP pattern should be entirely intended;
- Sometimes the app shows an error "the data couldn't be read because it isn't in the correct format", and sometimes it disappers without any code change. (Hope this happens because of xcode bugs); 
- When it happens alert called twice;
- getURL & getUser functions look to be similar. They should be combined into one
